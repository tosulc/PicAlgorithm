PicAlgorithm
=======

This application is a showcase of the algorithm used to shrink image from mobile gallery, walk through every pixel of it and then give back the result.

There is no TODO for this app 'cause it's just a showcase of the algorithm used for some parts of ScanColors and SimpleOCR apps.
It's full of commented code. Also, it's crying for optimization and prettier code.

Results:
	"FIRE AWAY!" - pixels of the picture is matched >= STATUS_PRAG in percentage with the given color (hardcoded in app)
	"Not good enough!" - pixels from the picture < STATUS_PRAG
	
FIRE AWAY and have fun!
